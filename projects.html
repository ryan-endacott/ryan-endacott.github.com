		<h3>Particle System</h3>
		<p>Fun little side project in Javascript utilizing the HTML5 Canvas.  Play with particles and very simple simulated gravity wells.  Additive color blending to make it look cool.</p>

		<h3>Personal Site</h3>
		<p>I've been working on this site in my spare time as a way to improve my design skills (they need work) and to show myself to the world!  Thus far, this is the result.</p>
