description: First post!  To keep track of potential topics.
---

Hello world!  This is my first ever Jekyll post on my first ever blog.  What a great way to herald in the new year!  I just hope that I can keep up with it and write often.

I think I'm going to use this first post to keep track of what I'd like to write about.  At least for now.



### Potential Topics:
* Stuff I like (e.g. Github contributions graph and current streak(maybe it will help me keep up with blogging))
* Particle system maybe?
* PHP (ugh)
* IdeaVIM letting me down (only slightly)
* Battlecode (If I ever get a semidecent bot done)
* MOOCs
* Writing is my achilles heel
* Goals, aspirations, finding your passion (I <3 code)
* Functional programming (once I gain a reasonable understanding.  So far I'm a fan.)
* Internship at HealthcareFirst
